README.md contents:
1. 
Brainwave_snippet is an excerpt from a MATLAB application "BrainWave" developed by Dr. Douglas Cheyne, The Hospital of Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
This folder contains only the single MATLAB script that I contributed to the app. 
BrainWave is an app designed by scientist Dr. Cheyne for his research in MEG and neuroimaging at SickKids Hospital, and I was fortunate to spend a summer working with him and gaining exposure to utilizing computation to analyze medical data.
Specifically, we were using MATLAB code to analyze the brain data (collected using an MEG) from paediatric patients with dystonic stroke.

The app contains over 50 .m files, so this script alone cannot accomplish anything. It simply contains my individual contribution to the project.
This is the first individual project I completed on MATLAB.
It is a graphing tool to visualize the head movement of a patient while they are having their brain scanned by an MEG system.
For this part of my summer project, I implemented MATLAB code that permitted scientists to select their MEG dataset, and visualize the distance that the participantâ€™s head moves while the MEG is scanning their brain activity. The program can be used to determine if there are any spikes in movement, and if certain time ranges need to be excluded from the analysis.

2.
Databases_3120 contains the assignments and coursework I completed in a third-year introduction to databases course at Western Unversity.
It showcases my learning of coding in SQL, PHP, html, etc.
In this course, students acquired practical skills in running a whole variety of different SQL queries through a university-hosted virtual machine.
Assignment 3 is a large, open-ended creative project where I designed a webpage to run SQL queries on a database containing course information at Western University

3.
Medical_Bioinformatics_3100 showcases lab projects I compeleted in an introduction to bioinformatics course at Western University. Inside, you will find my learning to use the command line.
Additionally, you will find my practice using a variety of command line programs used for:
- gene sequencing analysis
- gene alignment, annotation, mapping
There is R code that I used for gene expression analysis, gene annotation, GWAS studies, etc.


4.
OCT_thesis contains my largest ever completed coding project. It is my fourth-year thesis project where I used computation and MATLAB to analyse OCT imaging data of oral cancer patients.
Further info is included in a separate README.md in the OCT_thesis folder.

5.
AI_3121 contains my coursework in an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Western University. It contains instructions and my submissions for assignments and exams. All coursework was completed using Python. There are no self-directed projects in this folder. Some of the python scripts were supplied by the course instructor, and students were told to modify them by implementing machine learning algorithms taught in class.

The assignments all entered around a well-known Pac-Man problem, where students program the pac-man to eat food by using different search algorithms and heuristics to determine the lowest cost path. The python scripts used to accomplish these tasks can be found in the subfolders "multiagent" and "search".
