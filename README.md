Brainwave_snippet is an excerpt from a MATLAB application "BrainWave" developed by Dr. Douglas Cheyne, The Hospital of Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
This folder contains only the single MATLAB script that I contributed to the app. 
The app was designed by scientist Dr. Cheyne for his research in MEG and neuroimaging at SickKids Hospital, and I was fortunate to spend a summer working with him and gaining exposure to utlizing computation to analyze medical data.
Specifically, we were using MATLAB code to analyze the brain data (collected using an MEG) from pediatric patients with dystonic stroke.

The app contains over 50 .m files, so this script alone cannot accomplish anything.
This is the first individual project I completed on MATLAB.
It is a graphing tool to visualise the head movement of a patient while they are having their brain scanned by an MEG system

Databases_3120 contains the assignments and coursework I completed in a third-year introduction to databases course at Western Unversity.
It showcases my learning of coding in SQL, PHP, html, etc.
Assignment 3 is a large, open-ended creative project where I designed a webpage to run SQL queries on a database containing course information at Western University

Medical_Bioinformatics_3100 showcases lab projects I compeleted in an introduction to bioinformatics course at Western University. Inside, you will find my learning to use the command line.
Additionally, you will find my practice using a variety of command line programs used for:
- gene sequencing analysis
- gene alignment, annotation, mapping
There is R code that I used for gene expression analysis, gene annotation, GWAS studies, etc.

OCT_thesis contains my largest ever completed coding project. It is my fourth-year thesis project where I used computation and MATLAB to analyse OCT imaging data of oral cancer patients.
Further info is included in a separate README.md in the OCT_thesis folder.
