Upon completion of assignment 3 you will be able to:
Write a program using PHP and mysql that connects to a backend database
Allow a user to make updates, insertions, deletions and query a database
Create a program that runs on the internet
Create a Graphical User Interface using HTML and CSS
Instructions

MAKE SURE YOU PUT ALL YOUR CODE IN A SUBFOLDER OF /var/www/html called a3yourmiddlename  (e.g. mine would be a3kathryn) AND MAKE SURE YOU SET THE PERMISSIONS AS FOLLOWS ON YOUR cs3319.gaul.csd.uwo.ca SITE:

cd ~
cd /var/www/html
mkdir a3yourmiddlename
chmod 755 a3yourmiddlename

We are making the name a3yourmiddlename so that the name of your folder is unique and people can't see your code without you explicitly giving them the URL, I.E. so that the other students in the course can't find your folder and copy your html. They can't copy your php because it is hidden but they could copy your interface (your html, css and javascript files) so if you make the folder called a3yourmiddlename, it is hard for any student to guess that. If you do NOT have a middlename just pick a first name you wished your parents had given you :-) !

Put all your code in a3yourmiddlename folder and subfolders of a3yourmiddlename. Your URL will then be:
http://cs3319.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/vm???/a3yourmiddlename

Make sure all your files in the a3yourmiddlename directory have a permission of 644 (to do this, inside your a3yourmiddlename folder do this command):
chmod 644 filename.php
chmod 755 anysubdirectoriesthatyoumakeina3middlenamefolder

Using the database you created for assignment 2,CSS, HTML, PHP and MySQL (and JavaScript if you want, but you don't have to use JavaScript. It is possible to do the whole assignment without using JavaScript), create a website  that allows someone to update the Universities, Western Courses, Outside Courses and Equivalencies tables.  Here are the tasks a user must be able to complete

List all the Western Course Data.  Allow the user to order the courses by Course Number OR by Course Name (you might want to use a radio button for this choice).  For each of these 2 fields (num or name)  allow the user to either order them in ascending or descending order (you could also use a radio button for this choice).
Allow the user to select one of the Western Courses listed and change the Western course name or weight or suffix but do NOT allow the user to modify the Course number.
Allow the user to select one of the Western Courses listed and delete that course. If the course is equivalent to outside courses, make sure you warn the user about that before deleting the course and allow the user to change his/her mind. Any permanent deletions should always allow the user the chance to back out. 
Allow the user to enter a new Western Course.  The user should be able to enter all the information.   If the user enters a course number that already exists, give the user a warning message and do not allow it to be entered into the system. Make sure the user follows the rules of the course number starting with cs (it is up to you how you enforce that). 
Allow the user to select a university from the list of universities names in order by province and then see all the university information and see all that university's courses. 
Allow the user to select a province code and see all the university names and nicknames  from that province.
Allow the user to select a Western course by number  and see the name and the number and the weight of the western course and see the university name and the outside course name and outside course number and weight of all outside courses it is equivalent to.  Also show the date this equivalency was made. 
Allow the user to select a date and then show all equivalencies made before and including that date. For this query show the same information as in the previous bullet point. 
Allow the user to create a new equivalency between an existing outside course and an existing Western course.  Make the equivalency date to be the current date.  If the user is trying to create an equivalency that already exists, then just modify that row in the table by updating  the date to today's date.
List the names and nicknames of universities that are in our system but do not have any courses associated with them. 
Bonus (worth about 2%): add an extra field to the university table called uniimage (you can do this right in mysql at the command line,  not using php code, make it char(100)). Allow the user to click on one of the universities and if this field is null then let the user find an image online of the university's school mascot  and add the url to the university table AND display the image in your user interface. If the field is not null, display the image at the url.
It is a good habit to disconnect from a database once you have finished using it, make sure you program disconnects from the database. 

Remember that PHP can get large and cluttered, your application will be marked partly on your structure, comments and modularity, don't put everything in one file, try using PHP includes and functions and  separate files to break up the PHP code.

NOTE: you cannot use any third party DAL frameworks that let you avoid writing SQL queries/statements. We want you get experience writing SQL with this assignment.
